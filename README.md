The assessment principles:



You will receive two grades for this course (one for the tutorial and second for the exam).

Your tutorial grade will be calculated based on the number of points awarded for tasks, which have been divided into the following sections:

MS Word/Google Docs - 6 points,
Power Point/Google Slides - 4 points
Google Spreadsheets/Forms - 2 points
MS Excel - 6 points
Overleaf - 2 points
Databases (ERD) - 15 points
Databases (SQL) - 5 points
Point ranges corresponding to final grades for the tutorial:

         (2)       0  - 19 points
         (3)       19,5 – 23 points
         (3,5)    23,5 - 27 points
         (4)       27,5 - 31 points
         (4,5)    31,5 - 35 points
         (5)       35,5 - 40 points
 

Your exam grade depends on a final test (10 closed questions). You must pass the tutorial (obtain grade 3 or higher) to be admitted to the exam.

         (2)       0  - 4 points

         (3,5)    6 points
         (4)       7 points
         (4,5)    8 points
         (5)       9 - 10 points
